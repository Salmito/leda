Leda's TODO list:

   - Leda's documentation
   
   - Implement I/O stages for passing descriptors
   
   - Controller API
      - Pass the graph state to controllers
   
   - Build windows binaries for leda
   
   - Create a pending events queue for instances
      - Do not create a new instance if the recycle queue 
        is empty and every other instance is taken
   
   - Only allow function handlers, inits and sends
   
   - Optionally remove the TBB dependency by implementating a
     lockfree queue that operates the same way as the TBB concurrent_queue
     
   - Pass simple Lua tables between instances

Leda is a SEDA (Staged Event-Driven Architecture) implementation in Lua.

==========================================
======== Compiling and Installing ========
==========================================

Leda requires the Threading Building Blocks library (TBB). 
For more information on the tbb library: http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/
To install TBB on a Debian like linux (Ubuntu, mint, etc):
   apt-get install libtbb-dev

To build and install Leda for Lua 5.1:
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

To build and install Leda for Lua 5.2:
   $ make 5.2
   $ sudo make install5.2

To build and install Leda on both Lua versions:
   $ make clean
   $ sudo make install5.1
   $ make clean
   $ sudo make install5.2

To uninstall Leda on Lua 5.1:
   $ sudo make uninstall

To uninstall Leda on Lua 5.2:
   $ sudo make uninstall5.2

To cleanup compiler binaries:
   $ make clean

======================================
======== Testing installation ========
======================================
To test if the installation was successful type this command:

$ lua -l leda

You should get the lua prompt if leda is installed or the "module 'leda'
not found" error message if it cannot be loaded (or installed on a 
wrong location).

That's it.
